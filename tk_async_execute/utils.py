    """
    Executes a coroutine inside asyncio event loop.
    
    Call this from tkinter callbacks.

    Parameters
    ---------------
    coro: Coroutine
        The coro to run.
    wait: Optional[bool]
        Wait until the execution of ``coro`` has completed, before returning from this function.
        Defaults to True.

        **WARNING** If multiple executions are happening at once, due to the way tkinter's event loop works, this will
        wait for all executions to finish before returning from this function in the LIFO manner
        (last execution will be exited first).

    visible: Optional[bool]
        Show the execution progress through a new window.
        Defaults to True.
    pop_up: Optional[bool]
        If True, all other windows will be blocked from interactions, until the execution of ``coro`` is complete.
        Defaults to False.
    callback: Optional[Callable]
        Callback function to call with result afer coro has finished.
        Defaults to None.
    master: Any
        The parent tkinter widget.

    Returns
    -----------
    ExecutingAsyncWindow
        The progress TopLevel window responsible for ``coro`` execution.

    Raises
    --------
    Exception
        Exception that occurred in ``coro`` (if it ocurred). Only raised if ``wait`` is True.
